                        The outbreak of the Seven Years' War in Europe in 1756 resulted in renewed conflict
                        between French and British forces in India. The Third Carnatic War spread beyond southern
                        India and into Bengal where British forces captured the French settlement of Chandernagore
                        in 1757. However, the war was decided in the south, where the British successfully defended
                        Madras, and Sir Eyre Coote decisively defeated the French, commanded by Comte de Lally at
                        the Battle of Wandiwash in 1760. After Wandiwash, the French capital of Pondicherry fell to
                        the British in 1761. The war concluded with the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1763,
                        which returned Chandernagore and Pondichéry to France, and allowed the French to have
                        "factories" in India but forbade French traders from administering them. The French agreed
                        to support British client governments, thus ending French ambitions of an Indian empire and
                        making the British the dominant foreign power in India.

                            Early in his career Richard Grenville had some minor posts in the royal household.  On the death
                            of his father in 1523 he completed his father's term as Sheriff of Cornwall, a post he also held
                            in 1526-7, 1544-5.  In between he was Sheriff of Devon in 1532-3.  He was Justice of the Peace for
                            Cornwall from 1524 till his death and also in Devon, at Exeter from 1535 to 1547. Further afield
                            he was Marshal of Calais, a post that required his residence there, from October 1535 to October
                            1540.  In 1544 Grenville accompanied the King to France as a commander in the English army. He was
                            active in his Christian faith and openly favoured "God's word". In the Prayer Book Rebellion of
                            1549 Grenville was called upon against the western rebels, and with a company of friends and followers
                            he defended Trematon Castle. When they were unsuccessful in defending the castle, he and his wife were
                            held in custody in Launceston prison. Grenville contracted the illness probably while in gaol and died
                            from it on 18 March 1550.  He was buried at Kilkhampton five days later.
