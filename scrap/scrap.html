                   We are constructing a dataset to help computers be able to read a paragraph, and answer questions about the paragraph in the context of a situation. To test the computer’s ability to do this, we want to construct a dataset consisting of background paragraphs, situations, questions, and answers. Here is an example:
                        
                   </p>
                </div>
                <div class="goodbad">
                    <div class="passage-sample-2">
                        <table id="example" align="top" >
                        <tr>
                            <td valign="top" >
                                <p> <b> Background Paragraph: </b> <u> A rise in price of a good or service almost always decreases the quantity demanded of that good or service. </u> Conversely, a fall in price will increase the quantity demanded. When the price of a gallon of gasoline increases, for example, people look for ways to reduce their consumption by combining several errands, commuting by carpool or mass transit, or taking weekend or vacation trips closer to home. Economists call this inverse
                                relationship between price and quantity demanded the law of demand. The law of demand assumes that all other variables that affect demand (which we explain in the next module) are held constant </p>
                            </td>
                            <td valign="top">

                                <p> <b>Situation: </b> The AAA auto club does a weekly report on the prices of gas and diesel in various cities. Historically, the prices have be fairly stagnant, but this week their report garnered widespread attention as the prices of gas and diesel plunged from last week in Seattle by $0.40 each. However, just across the border in Vancouver, the cost of gas went up dramatically by $0.50. </p>
                                <p> <b>Question: </b> Which city will have geater increase in demand for gas? </p>
                                <p> <b>Answer: </b> Seattle</p>
                            </td>
                        <tr>
                        </table>
                    </div>
                </div>
        <div>
            
        <p>Our goal is to have the computer be able to read the the background paragraph and understand the relationship that it describes well enough to apply the knowledge to a situation. In the example above, if the computer understands the relationship it will be able to use it to understand that in the situation that since the prices of gas rose in Vancouver, there will likely be a decrease in the quantity demanded. And since the prices in Seattle decreased, there will likely be an
        increase in the quantity demanded. </p>
        <p>The background paragraphs will be provided and the HIT is to come up with the <b>situations</b>, <b>questions</b>, and <b> answers </b>. </p>
        <p> <b>Background paragraphs </b> will describe one or more causal or qualitative relationship, for example, it could be a relationship in economics or a scientic law.. <b> Situations </b> will be exam-style story questions that involve the relationship described in the text. The <b> questions </b> will be about the situation that require understanding the relationship described in the first background paragraph. The <b> answers </b> will be a span from either the question or the paragraph.</p>
        </div>

        <p> To complete the HIT:  </p>
        <ol>
            <li> Start by reading the <b> background paragraph </b> at the bottom of the page, and determine what relationship(s) are in the paragraph. There are 5 background paragraphs given so feel free to click NEXT PASSAGE to look through other paragraphs.</li>
            <li> Write a exam-style <b>situation</b> that involves the relationship(s) that you determined are in the background paragraph. Try to <b> use your own words </b> as much as possible and not repeat the background paragraph.</li> 
            <li> Write a question about the situation that requires relationship in the background paragraph to answer </li>
            <li> Write the answer to the question. After you author each question, the AI will also also attempt to answer the question and you can check what the AI thinks the answer is. Out of the 10 questions, the AI must not be able to answer over half of them. <b> If the AI is able to answer over half of them you won't be able to submit the HIT </b> </li>
            <li> Continue to write question answer pairs. Once you are done asking questions about a situation, write a new situation. You can write multiple question answer pairs for each situation, and multiple situations for each paragraph. </li>
            <li> Once you have 10 question answer pairs in total -- you are done! If the ADD QUESTION or READY TO SUBMIT HIT buttons are not active, hover your mouse on them to know the reason. </li>

        </ol>

                    <p> <b> Background Paragraph: </b> Economists have attempted to estimate how much the minimum wage reduces the quantity demanded of low-skill labor. A typical result of such studies is that a 10% increase in the minimum wage would decrease the hiring of unskilled workers by 1 to 2%, which seems a relatively small reduction. In fact, some studies have even found no effect of a higher minimum wage on employment at certain times and places—although these studies are controversial </p>

On the other hand, if a large number of resources are already committed to education, then committing additional resources will bring relatively smaller gains. </p>

For example, the U.S. government imposes a tax on alcoholic beverages that collects about $8 billion per year from producers. Businesses treat taxes as costs. <u> Higher costs decrease supply for the reasons we discussed above. </u> Other examples of policy that can affect cost are the wide array of government regulations that require firms to spend money to provide a cleaner environment or a safer workplace. Complying with regulations increases costs. </p>
