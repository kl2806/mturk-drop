                        This task involves creating questions and answers from a given passage that involve some kind of complex reasoning.
                        The answer to the question can be words from the passage, dates, or numbers.  The most important point is that the
                        questions require looking at more than one part of the passage to answer.  We will make sure that the questions are
                        sufficiently complex by running a simple question answering system on your question; if the system gets the answer
                        right, the question is too easy.  The more you create challenging questions, the more you earn.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Below, we provide some example questions that involve different kinds of reasoning.  Try to use a variety of
                        reasoning types in the questions you come up with, and also have a variety of answer types (spans, numbers, dates).
                        A <b><i>span</i></b> is a continuous phrase taken directly from the passage or question. You can directly copy-paste the text from the
                        passage or question into span box. If you find multiple spans, please use the '+/-' button to add/remove. Please restrict each span to five words.
                        You can either separate a span into multiple spans if the answer is a list. If you are unable to do so, please try writing a more specific question.
                        A <b><i>number</i></b> type answer can include a digit specifying an actual value. Number-type answer can only accept a <i>"How many ..."</i> type question.
                        So remember to phrase the corresponding question for any number-type answer correctly. For instance, <i>"How long did an event last?"</i> can
                        be phrased as <i>"How many years did an event last?"</i>.  A <b><i>date</i></b> type answer can be used to specify a date with the help of a date selector.

                        The outbreak of the Seven Years' War in Europe in 1756 resulted in renewed conflict
                        between French and British forces in India. The Third Carnatic War spread beyond southern
                        India and into Bengal where British forces captured the French settlement of Chandernagore
                        in 1757. However, the war was decided in the south, where the British successfully defended
                        Madras, and Sir Eyre Coote decisively defeated the French, commanded by Comte de Lally at
                        the Battle of Wandiwash in 1760. After Wandiwash, the French capital of Pondicherry fell to
                        the British in 1761. The war concluded with the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1763,
                        which returned Chandernagore and Pondichéry to France, and allowed the French to have
                        "factories" in India but forbade French traders from administering them. The French agreed
                        to support British client governments, thus ending French ambitions of an Indian empire and
                        making the British the dominant foreign power in India.

                            Early in his career Richard Grenville had some minor posts in the royal household.  On the death
                            of his father in 1523 he completed his father's term as Sheriff of Cornwall, a post he also held
                            in 1526-7, 1544-5.  In between he was Sheriff of Devon in 1532-3.  He was Justice of the Peace for
                            Cornwall from 1524 till his death and also in Devon, at Exeter from 1535 to 1547. Further afield
                            he was Marshal of Calais, a post that required his residence there, from October 1535 to October
                            1540.  In 1544 Grenville accompanied the King to France as a commander in the English army. He was
                            active in his Christian faith and openly favoured "God's word". In the Prayer Book Rebellion of
                            1549 Grenville was called upon against the western rebels, and with a company of friends and followers
                            he defended Trematon Castle. When they were unsuccessful in defending the castle, he and his wife were
                            held in custody in Launceston prison. Grenville contracted the illness probably while in gaol and died
                            from it on 18 March 1550.  He was buried at Kilkhampton five days later.

                <h2 id="Q1">Let's start writing some questions now!</h2>
                <h4> <b>The Rules of the task are as follows : </b></h4>
                <ol>
                    <li> Given a passage, you need to create questions that can be answered from the passage. </li>
                    <li>
                        You have five passages to pick from, and between these five passages, you must create at least 12 questions to
                        submit the HIT.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once you create the question, you need to write its answer, either in the form of a date, a number, or spans
                        copied directly from the passage.
                    </li>
                    <li> There is an AI running in the background which will also try to answer the question.</li>
                    <li> You won't be able to submit the question if the AI gives the same reponse. </li>
                    <li>
                        You can go back and forth between the passages, and you can edit questions by clicking on them.  Once you have
                        finished all 12 questions, go to the last passage to submit the HIT.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Some passages are easier to generate questions from than others, so if you have a hard time, move to a different passage.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the "ADD QUESTION" or "READY TO SUBMIT HIT" buttons are not active, hover your mouse on them to know the reason.
                    </li>

             Just as a reminder, here are some patterns that often give good questions.  Combining ideas
             from several of these examples is even better. It's often good to use comparatives ("more", "longer", "farther")
             or superlatives ("most", "shortest") in questions. Here are some example question types for more help. Please note that
             these are just templates, DO NOT use the word <b>"EVENT"</b> directly in the question, replace it with an actual event mention.
